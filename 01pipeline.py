I have never before faced Dymphna in tournament play, nor played with 
the sonic balls the blind require, but I watched him barely dispatch Petropolis Kahn in 
the Round of 16, and I know he is mine. It will start in the E.R., at the intake desk if C.T.'s 
late in following the ambulance, or in the green-tiled room after the room with the 
invasive-digital machines; or, given this special M.D.-supplied ambulance, maybe on the 
ride itself: some blue-jawed M.D. scrubbed to an antiseptic glow with his name sewn in 
cursive on his white coat's breast pocket and a quality desk-set pen, wanting gurneyside 
Q&A, etiology and diagnosis by Socratic method, ordered and point-by-point. There are, 
by the O.E.D. VI's count, nineteen nonarchaic synonyms for unresponsive, of which nine 
are Latinate and four Saxonic. I will play either Stice or Polep in Sunday's final. Maybe in 
front of Venus Williams. It will be someone blue-collar and unlicensed, though, 
inevitably — a nurse's aide with quick-bit nails, a hospital security guy, a tired Cuban 
orderly who addresses me as jou — who will, looking down in the middle of some kind 
of bustled task, catch what he sees as my eye and ask So yo then man what's your story? '''
